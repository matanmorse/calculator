# calculator
A four-function calculator built for The Odin Project

## Features
Four-function calculation (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) with interactive, responsive user interface. Chain equations together using the result of previous calculations. Keyboard compatability, works with negatives and floats, and can backspace numbers.

## Technologies
CSS + HTML for site look, Javascript for logic and calculations

## Lessons Learned
This was the final project for the "Foundations" course of The Odin Project. As such I had to use a lot of the skills I learned throughout the entire course in this project. I'm quite proud of the user interface since I designed it almost
entirely myself, and since it uses vh units for the size of the calculator, it looks quite good on many different displays, however making a responsive layout was not one of the main goals of this project. The scope of this project
was greater than any I'd done for TOP before, so I learned a lot about planning out a project, starting with simple features but planning and designing ahead for features which needed to be added in the future. I implemented
many different functions for actions the calculator would need to perform (evaluate expression, change display, backspace, etc.) and I was able to use these functions to quickly and easily add new features such as keyboard integration.
For this reason I didn't have as many bugs as I suspect I would have otherwise, and by this point I feel quite confident about my basic abilities with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
